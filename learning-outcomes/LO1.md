# Learning Outcome 1
# Development and Deployment of Enterprise Software as a Professional
>You develop and deploy enterprise software, both individually and as a team. You select a suitable enterprise development platform and application framework(s). You select and apply a software development process, which complies with professional industry standards. You actively share knowledge within your team and with stakeholders to improve knowledge & processes.

*Enterprise software is used in the context of companies which use large-scale distributed software, with many types of users, and substantial amounts of data.
In such a context, you will develop software and software related products (for instance software design, test setups). All of this should be transferable to the current stakeholders, and software engineers who work on the software after you leave.
Together with your team you agree upon a way of working that is considered professional in a large IT software organization. This software development process should be agile to accommodate future changes (for instance scrum).
Your behaviour supports the chosen way of working. You consistently share technical knowledge and experiences of the software development process both inside and outside the team.
Besides requirements needed by direct stakeholders, you also take other viewpoints into account which are relevant (for instance GDPR, ethical & legal issues). It is your job that all your results can be verified, validated, and transferred to others.*

## Develop & Deploy Enterprise Software
### Individual
**Individually**, I am developing a digital tool intended for use by schools ran by *Dixons Academies Trust*. All source code, documentation and details of this project can be found under this organization:
https://github.com/knowledge-navigator

The project is deployed here: ~~currently under development~~

### Group
I am also part of the development **team** responsible for creating a *Baby Monitoring Simulator*. All source code, documentation and details of this project can be found under this organization: https://github.com/Baby-Monitor-Simulator

The project is deployed here: ~~currently under development~~

## Select Suitable Enterprise Development Tech Stack
### Individual
I have selected the following tech stack for my individual project:
- Backend API Gateway (`REST`): [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ([Warp Framework](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp)) 
- Frontend User Interface (`SSR`): [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) (v3)
- Object-Relational Database (`SQL`): [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Group
We have selected the following tech stack for our group project:
- Backend: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- Frontend: [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)

## Select & Apply Professional Software Development Process & Actively Share Knowledge Through Communication
We are utilizing **Scrum**, **Agile** project management through having boards with a ticket system whereby code is frequently reviewed, stakeholders are involved and development is carefully completed through defined issues and branches. See our project boards for more details on this:
- [Personal Project Shared Board](https://github.com/orgs/knowledge-navigator/projects/1)
- [Group Backend Board](https://github.com/orgs/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/projects/1)
- [Group Frontend Board](https://github.com/orgs/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/projects/3)

Additionally we have [templates for tickets/issues](https://github.com/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/s6-baby-monitor-simulator-webui/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue-ticket-template.md) as well as [branch naming conventions defined in our contribution rules](https://github.com/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/s6-baby-monitor-simulator-webui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We are in constant communication with our stakeholders through common meetings (planned through **Teams** and **Outlook**) as well as having three-week sprints where we perform retrospectives, planning and have a deeper conversation with all stakeholders.
