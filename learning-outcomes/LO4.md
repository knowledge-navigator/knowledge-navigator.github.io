# Learning Outcome 4 - Targetted Interaction
> You use appropriate communication considering your role in a team, your audience and the medium to convey your message and results of your software development process.

- Together with your team, you agree upon a way of working that is considered professional in a large IT software organization and that enables you to communicate with stakeholders about the progress and results of your project. This software development process should be agile to accommodate future changes (for instance, scrum). Your behavior supports the chosen way of working.  

- You have an active attitude to share your ideas, viewpoints, technical knowledge and experiences in or outside your team that contribute to an improvement of solutions or software development process. Besides requirements needed by direct stakeholders, you also take other viewpoints into account which are relevant (for instance GDPR, ethical & legal issues).  

- You demonstrate a professional attitude in all forms of communication. 

## Professional Way of Working
I defined and planned most of the way of working inside of my team, following strict guidelines similar to that of a professional and large IT software organization. Some of the key aspects that I orchestrated include:
- setting up 'organizations' inside of GitHub, grouping all repositories together ([Personal](https://github.com/knowledge-navigator) & [Group](https://github.com/Baby-Monitor-Simulator))
- setting up a professional scrum board through GitHub projects ([Personal](https://github.com/orgs/knowledge-navigator/projects/1) & [Group](https://github.com/orgs/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/projects/1))
- setting up tickets system (in board) with templates ([see here](https://github.com/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/S6BabyMonitor/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue-ticket-template.md))
- defining definitions of complete and organizing branches
- working in *agile* fashion and implementing many *scrum* elements:
    - sprints
    - retrospectives and reviews
    - planning tickets
    - sprint goals

We set up regular meetings with all stakeholders, thus communicating effectively between all involved and interested members of this project.

## Actively Sharing Knowledge
I am constantly sharing all my knowledge in and outside of the team to enhance the development process of the project. Additionally, I am also taking into account, ethical and legal issues that could be prevelant in both the group and personal project.
