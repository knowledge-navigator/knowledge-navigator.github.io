# Learning Outcome 2
# Context Based Research
> You deliver professional products according to planning, which are the result of a structured and methodical investigation. You have a critical view towards your own and other peopleâ€™s work, by comparing them to alternatives, judge the structured and methodical approach and consider general accepted and ethical values. Your products are validated with stakeholders and other available research, and you can judge & communicate the relevance and value of the project in its own context.

*You apply critical thinking in your day-to-day work. In your planning, you can divide your work into questions which need investigation. Each investigation has a goal which can be validated and is relevant and valuable for your specific context.
You use a well-known methodology (for instance the DOT framework) to structure your investigation. The result of the investigation is validated by you and shows the quality and value of the result.
The result of your investigation can be justified and presented by you, both verbally and in writing. Others can validate the results, making the results transferable to others.
One of the ongoing investigations is: keeping an eye on the current state of development of your products (for instance using the Technological Readiness Level).*

## Delivery of Professional Products with Structured and Methodical Investigation following a Rigorous Planning
All research can be found here: [Various Research Documentation](../README.md) under *Additional Research* heading

Additionally, planning and structure is demonstrated through our scrum boards and templates:
- [Personal Project Shared Board](https://github.com/orgs/knowledge-navigator/projects/1)
- [Group Backend Board](https://github.com/orgs/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/projects/1)
- [Group Frontend Board](https://github.com/orgs/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/projects/3)

See the [templates for tickets/issues](https://github.com/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/s6-baby-monitor-simulator-webui/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue-ticket-template.md) as well as [branch naming conventions defined in our contribution rules](https://github.com/Baby-Monitor-Simulator/s6-baby-monitor-simulator-webui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
